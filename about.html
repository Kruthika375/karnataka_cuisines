                  <h1>About Karnataka Cuisine</h1>
                  <p>
                     In Karnataka, the meal (called, Kannadiga Oota in local language) is served on a banana leaf. The service generally begins from the top right-hand side of the leaf with uppu (salt) placed first, followed by Kosambari (south Indian salad), Pickle, Palya (vegetable side dish), Raita or gojju (vegetable cooked in tamarind juice), desserts, fried dishes, Thovve (cooked dal),
                     huli (a thick broth of lentils and vegetables), Chitranna (rice-based dish), plain rice and ghee â€“ in that order.

            <p>The fixed menu varies from day to day. After bringing water to wash your hands in a near ceremonial style, they brought us a veritable barrage of dishes. Different kinds of chutneys, rotis and puri, with so many side dishes.
                The food was rich and not for the diet conscious, but fantastic for a once in a way treat.</p>
